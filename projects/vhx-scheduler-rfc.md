# VHX Scheduler

**This is a proposal but as a set of features.**

PLease comment on it. This file will disappear into TO-DOs on the following projects if the RFC
is approved:
 - a standalone project.

We expect this for Spring 2019.

## Description
*What is the purpose of this project?*

This is to allow volunteers to gain and lose privilege as the event
progresses so let the backend be more secure for hackers. This may
also streamline the life of a VHX director.

Basic features (minimal viable product):
- Scheduling for volunteers and mentors.
    - This may have to close at a certain date.
- Automatic escalation and de-escalation of privilege through LCS.
- An override for directors to mark volunteers and mentors as present or absent.

## Inspiration
*How did this project come to be?*

LCS complaints.

## Installation Guide
*How do the users get this up and running?*

**This is a proposal.**

Here are a few tentative steps to get this to work:
1. Get a DB with a scheduler.
1. Integrate LCS.
1. Frontend?

## Example Uses

Volunteer shift sign-up: volunteers and mentors will be able to sign up for shifts until a certain date.

The directors will be able to account for who's supposed to be there doing what and when on some sort of frontend.

## Style Guide

N/A

## TO-DO List

Get the RFC approved by VHX.

## Links to Further docs

N/A for now.

## Other crazy extensions

- Text reminds for volunteers and mentors of their shifts.
  - Perhaps push notifications in the apps.
