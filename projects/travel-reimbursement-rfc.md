# Travel Reimbursement Estimator

**This is a proposal and may never exist as a standalone project, but as a set of features.**

PLease comment on it. This file will disappear into TO-DOs on the following projects if the RFC
is approved:
 - a standalone project.
 - (unlikely, but may be) LCS.

We expect this for Spring 2019.

## Description
*What is the purpose of this project?*

This project should be a director-accessed tool that estimates travel reimbursements.
Hopefully it will be able to web-scrape.

There is an MVP and a related issue on LCS (see https://github.com/HackRU/lcs/issues/42).

## Inspiration
*How did this project come to be?*

Doing it by hand.

## Installation Guide
*How do the users get this up and running?*

**This is a proposal.**

It can more or less just be a static site or an endpoint that a director logins in to.
It'll then just modify the DB through LCS as needed.

## Example Uses

Literally just the estimation of travel reimbursement.

## Style Guide

N/A

## TO-DO List

Get the RFc approved by logistics.

## Links to Further docs

N/A for now.

## Other crazy extensions

These are just ideas. Based on past conversations with finance or experience, they are unlikely to be
useful or worth the effort.
- Let users upload their documentation onto this.
  - OCR verification?
- Paypal or amazon integration to give them the money directly (this is a bureaucratic hell-hole).
