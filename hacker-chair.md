# Hacker Chair

### Position

This position involves maintaining the hacker community at RU.  It involes two aspects
  * Project building awareness
  * Hackathon awareness and travel coordination
  * Newsletter Post
  
A bulk of this position is monitoring and maintaing Rutgers Hackathon Club.

#### Project Building Awareness

Part of this position is project building awareness.  Essentially people who are working on projects, get them to continue doing what they are doing but make the community more aware of it to give more people motivation to build as well as it being something awesome to share.

**Project Awareness**

There are several steps this can be done:
* Ask around the CAVE/be aware of what's being worked on.
* Check the last hackathon for Rutgers Submissions
* Check previous HackRU projects

After a project is found then it can be **Featured** on Rutgers Hackathon Club and possibly the Usacs Newsletter after getting the consent of the person who built the hack of course.

Be sure to constantly market people to join **Rutgers Hackathon Club** so people can find a place to share their hacks!

**Project Building**

As for project building phase, feature what is being worked on by people and try to help form teams for people looking to work on projects as well.

#### Hackathon Awareness


Another part of this position is getting people to know the hackathons that are coming up and try to increase attendance by coordinating travel.

**Hackathon Awareness**

The best way found so far is to create FB Events from the USACS page and reposting them to Rutgers Hackathon Club.  Not everybody is in USACS!! There are a lot of other Computer Science clubs as well so RHC can act as a hub for these events.

There are several hackathons that we are **Partnered** with so contact HackRU for that so we can create them first.  Other than that be practical about the hackathons that are being created!  Aim for creating a survey to see what hackathons people are interested in as well so we can create events for them as well! 

**Hackathon Event Creation Processs**
The purpose of the events is to see who is interested in going to a hackathon and who is actually going so people can travel with each other.  There are several steps that go into the creation process:

1. Find the Hackathon's Facebook Page
2. Create event in Rutgers USACS: "Rutgers Storms -----"
3. Set the Correct Date/Time and Location
4. Take the Banner and Description from that Facebook Page over
 * If there is no description add one from the hackathon's site
5. Add the hackathon's site as the ticket URL
6. Set as Networking Event
7. Publish and repost on Rutgers Hackathon Club
8. **1 week from Hackathon** Post Group chat is being created
9. Add over everyone marked as **Going**
10. Link the page to social media and monitor!
 * Repost to Rutgers CS Discord!
 * Invite people to the event!
 * Add to link to page in USACS Newsletter!
