## Overview

We would love to have your help for our Research and Development team with your knowledge from hackathons and the industry with team management, code reviewing, code maintenance, and anything else you are able to help contribute with.

## Structure

### Team

The team consists 4 roles:
* Directors
* Project Leads
* Architects
* Alumni Mentors

#### Directors, Project Leads, Architects
The way that our projects are structured are with Directors, Project Leads, and Architects(also known as organizers).  Directors overlook the projects that are being made and the structure of the team as well as convey updates to the rest of the HackRU team.  Project Leads manage and build the project they are assigned to with their team of Architects.

#### Alumni Mentors
The role we would like  Alumini Mentors to have is to help mentor Project Leads and their Architects with proper version control and coding styles that are used in industry as well as help with common issues that new developers may face as well as anything else you would like to help contribute with.

### Projects
Projects that are being worked on will be maintained on GitHub on the [HackRU](http://www.github.com/HackRU) repository.  Each project team will have their own repository per project.  They may have more repositiories only if necessary but hopefully that is not that case for more of the projects.  Teams will be working on projects with their Project Leads weekly.  Every week there will also be an update as well with the whole team together to see the progress of all the projects and whatever else that may be necessary such as assets from other teams.  Projects can range from projects for HackRU or projects for the open source community as a whole.

The  maintenance of projects will be through [feature branches](https://github.com/HackRU/handbook/blob/master/project-leads.md#feature-branches-and-the-rd-dev-flow) and any other practices that can be used to improve project management on github.

Depending on the language, code will written conform to a style guide.  The style guide will be determined by the help of Alumni Mentors, Directors, and Project Leads.  Once a style guide is decided on, that will be the style guide that is followed for anything that is written in the langauge it corresponds to for any project in the team.

## Code Review
Code review will be determined based off of the style guide chosen for that particular language.  Once a style guide is chosen than we would have the help of Alumni mentors determine if code is conforming to it correctly.  Code review will also assist with determining if certain code is being written the most efficient way, conforming to proper data structures and other algorithms. 

## Code Maintenance
As mentioned [earlier](#projects) projects will be maintained on github.  Would we love to have the assistance of Alumni Mentors to determine if correct code version control practices are being used.  In the end these projects are all open source and we would love others outside of our team to be able to use and contribute to projects as much and as as easy as they can.

## Meetings
We are hoping project leads will be able to meet with Project Leads and their teams regularly to see the project is being created propery and to assist in questions that teams.  Ideally it would be very helpful if Alumni Mentors can help check up on their teams weekly or biweekly to keep up witht the progress of their team.  Direct contact through the development process within the week is very much encouraged as well.  We will be using Discord as our main location for all communication.  Directors will asssit in creating documents of questions as well for Alumni Mentor-Project Team meetings based off of certain teams progress and needs.
