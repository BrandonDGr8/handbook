## What is Dev Team and Why? (8min)

* The way we describe a dev team is a team that builds projects for the hackathon but also builds projects for the CS community as well. 
* The importance of having a dev team helps us apply what we learn in real world scenarios and build meaningful projects. 
* It also helps keeps the hacking community alive in you CS community with the continuous building of projects. 
* Builds projects for the hackathon. 
* Can build for the real world. 
    - Teaches you about dealing with users. 
    - Experience getting requirements etc. like real-world dev scenarios. 
    - Best practices 

* Community. 
    - Keep the project building tradition alive 
    - Exposure for CS community - other hackathons can use your stuff. 

  

* How the dev team interacts with the hackathon and community 
    - With the hackathon 
    - Taking on projects/involvement 
        - Know to say no (if you know you have to) 
        - Project descriptions and details! 
            - Get everything in writing 

    - Our team and the way it interacts with itself 
        - Project leads 

    - You might have to talk to the whole hackathon. 
        - Bother people!! 
        - Just because they can code doesn’t mean they’ll understand you. 

    - Your marketing is done through your registration website, so it’s critical that branding matches up. 
    - Make sure that your other teams are aware of your work, projects, and “lifecycle.” 
    - Figure out where the team fits within your school’s CS ecosystem (brainstorm) 
        - Other open source clubs? 
        - Reach out to other Departments that might have projects/might need help!
