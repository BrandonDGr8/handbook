# Project Lead Meeting 10/28/2018
## Team Updates

- All is decent
- Please confirm the number of architects you want (we wrote down what you put last week)
- Please follow up with what we need to ask if we still want a UX designer, though it's getting a little late,
  so next week deadline for this HackRU.
- We sent out interviews to Sam and Shivan. We will continue interviewing and briefing Mickey and Kabir on the
  process.
- If you want architects, please prepare an interview question. Reach out to us (or `#project-leads`) if you need help.

**Create a new branch, fill out this document for your project section, and create a pull request**
