# Project Lead Meeting 10/14 -- Post Mortem
## Team Updates

- Yay, no more HackRU for a... week?
- But we needa check on last one... here's post mortem.
- Let us know of any improvements.
- We have some re-structuring and new projects to discuss.
    - [See below](#personnel-changes)
- New projects:
    - Admin Dash role updater (ticket on the frontend along
      with the completion of the emailing portion).
    - VHX scheduling
    - Sponsor portal
    - Travel-reimbursement app
- New policy: if anybody (MLH, devpost) wants software to be used at
  HackRU by non-hackers, they must consult us at least a month (6 weeks?)
  beforehand.

## Personnel Changes

- We might (re)move the following architects and project leads:
    - Ross
    - Duc - at least move, perhaps to travel reimbursements?
- The following project-related shuffling is planned:
    - Amulya to lead team builder.
    - Sri to lead the VHX scheduler and sponsor portal.
      (The portal is too small to justifiably split.)
    - Coding samples is officially dead (again).
    - Sunny to lead iOS.
    - Kabir to lead frontend (as Ez graduates).
        - Small issue: I want one director to be leading LCS
          (RnD is much easier if a director and the backend
          dude share a brain.) This means we'll need helpq
          to be inheritted soon after its re-write. (Or Mickey
          can somewhat take over LCS now (with Heman occassionally
          stepping on his toes) and somebody else re-writes
          helpq....?)
- New people?
    - Beginners as architects is untenable, so we need to figure that out.
        - Beginner = can't deploy a basic web app or mobile app without learning
          something new.
    - Shivan and Sam Olagun are excellent frontend candidates, especially for
      an MnD liason. We could look into adding them.
    - We will have you interview any new architects you need.
