            -Yeeting all that into Travis CI
            -Refactoring code to minimize test trees per function
            -Documentation is still in progress (diagrams are hard)

_TO DO_: There are a growing number of visual issues cropping up which we will need to tackle after Admin and Travel - haven't figured out a deadline for this yet.
