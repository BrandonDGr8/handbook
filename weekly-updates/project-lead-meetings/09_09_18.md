    - TENTATIVE - 08/26/18-09/18/18 : DayOf Dash @exec @mnd  ‘optional’: 
 - We should clean up the way we do a walk through.
    - Make sure you show the functionality **and** how to deploy it.
    - Please be ready on time! In the case of hackathons (and other issues), I understand, but we should plan
      a "rain date" where the relevant directors and project leads are availible.
 - We want "paper alternatives" to most projects. I've put some thoughts on that, but please add
   or improve on them.
    - Paper includes tech that is used in industry or it otherwise not dependant on RnD.
    - Also try to handle a lack of internet.
